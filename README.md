# LibraryManagementSystem
A simple library management system works for adding/removing/borrowing books and handling users.

Python 3 and Flask is required to run the database app. 
Navigate the project folder and enter the command to install necessary libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
After the installization, run created.py from terminal or IDE. This will create a library database with some sample data. If you already have the database from last use, this step is not necessary.
Then you can run dbapp.py and open the given address from your internet browser to connect to local host.
Enjoy the app.
